# Band_Searching
- First, opening MySQL Server on localhost and creating an user, password whatever are acceptable. 

- A database named record_company has to be created with tables containing albums, bands, and songs by running the .sql files in the folder "record_company".

- The sql-connector.jar should be set up properly in the IDE with an approriate version.

- Then run the query.java file in which people are required to input the database, username, password, and the BAND NAME that they want to search.
